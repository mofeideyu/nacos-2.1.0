     * To control routing for traffic bound to services outside the mesh, external
     * services must first be added to Istio's internal service registry using the
     * ServiceEntry resource. VirtualServices can then be defined to control traffic

     * Service for wikipedia.org and set a timeout of 5s for HTTP requests.
